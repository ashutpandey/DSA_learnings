# DSA_learnings

A concise, practical 3-month roadmap to learn Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

This repository contains a study plan, curated resources, and practice recommendations to take you from fundamentals to interview-ready in 12 weeks.

**How to use this guide**
- **Daily commitment:** 1.5–3 hours on weekdays, 3–6 hours on weekends (adjust to your availability).
- **Weekly structure:** Learn concepts (videos/reading) → implement data structures/algorithms → solve practice problems → review and revise.
- **Languages:** Use a single language for consistency (Python, Java, C++, or JavaScript). Implement and solve problems in that language.

**Goals after 12 weeks**
- Confident with core data structures and their implementations.
- Able to analyze time/space complexity and optimize solutions.
- Comfortable solving medium-to-hard competitive/interview problems.

**12-Week Study Plan (High Level)**

Weeks 1–2 — Foundations & Complexity
- Topics: Big-O notation, recursion, iteration, arrays, strings
- Goals: Master array/string operations, two-pointer technique, simple recursion
- Practice: Implement array manipulations, sliding window problems

Weeks 3–4 — Linked Lists & Stacks/Queues
- Topics: Singly/doubly linked lists, circular lists, stack, queue, deque
- Goals: Implement operations (insert, delete, reverse), use stacks/queues to solve problems
- Practice: Reverse linked list, detect cycle, evaluate postfix expressions

Weeks 5–6 — Trees & Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Topics: Tree traversals (pre/in/post), BST properties, recursion on trees
- Goals: Implement traversals, insert/delete/search in BST, LCA
- Practice: Level-order traversal, validate BST, serialize/deserialize tree

Weeks 7–8 — Heaps, Hashing, and Maps
- Topics: Binary heap (priority queue), hash tables, collision handling, sets/maps
- Goals: Implement heap operations, use hashing to speed up lookups
- Practice: Top K elements, frequency counting, two-sum variants

Weeks 9–10 — Graphs & Advanced Traversals
- Topics: Graph representations (adjacency list/matrix), BFS, DFS, shortest paths (Dijkstra), topological sort
- Goals: Implement BFS/DFS, detect cycles, shortest path basics
- Practice: Connected components, shortest path on weighted/unweighted graphs

Weeks 11 — Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Topics: Memoization, bottom-up DP, knapsack, LIS, DP on strings
- Goals: Recognize overlapping subproblems, convert recursion to DP
- Practice: Fibonacci variants, coin change, longest common subsequence

Week 12 — Put It Together & Interview Prep
- Topics: Mixed problems, time/space trade-offs, common patterns (sliding window, two pointers, divide & conquer)
- Goals: Solve timed mock interviews, review weak areas, refine explanations
- Practice: Timed problem-solving sessions, explain solutions aloud, mock interviews

---

Recommended Weekly Workflow
- Day 1–2: Learn new topic (video + reading) and implement base data structure/algorithm.
- Day 3–4: Solve 4–6 practice problems (easy → medium) applying the new topic.
- Day 5: Review, write clean implementations, add notes to a personal cheat-sheet.
- Weekend: 2–3 longer problems (medium → hard), refactor code, and run a mock interview.

Resources (curated)
- Books: "Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS) — deep reference; "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick — practical approach.
- Online Courses: Coursera "Data Structures and Algorithms" Specializations, MIT OpenCourseWare, or freeCodeCamp DSA tracks.
- Interactive Sites: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces (practice contests), AtCoder, GeeksforGeeks for tutorials.
- Visualizers & Helpers: VisuAlgo, AlgoExpert (paid), Big-O Cheat Sheets, and LeetCode Explore paths.

Recommended Problems by Topic (starter list)
- Arrays/Strings: Two Sum, Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Linked Lists: Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists, Linked List Cycle
- Trees: Binary Tree Inorder Traversal, Maximum Depth, Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
- Graphs: Number of Islands, Course Schedule (topological sort), Dijkstra practice
- DP: Climbing Stairs, Coin Change, Longest Increasing Subsequence

Study Tips & Best Practices
- Focus on patterns: Many problems reuse a small set of techniques (two-pointers, sliding window, backtracking, DP patterns).
- Implement from scratch: Writing your own linked list, heap, and graph implementations cements understanding.
- Explain aloud: Practice explaining your solution and complexity; it’s crucial for interviews.
- Keep a notebook or markdown notes: Save problem patterns, pitfalls, and optimized solutions.
- Use a single editor/IDE and version control: Keep solutions organized by topic in this repo.

Interview Preparation
- Start mock interviews in week 10–12; timeboxed problems (30–45 minutes). Use platforms like Pramp or Interviewing.io.
- Master whiteboard-friendly explanation: break down the approach, complexity analysis, and edge cases.
- Review system design basics if interviewing for senior roles.

Contributing & Structure Suggestions
- Organize solutions under folders: `arrays/`, `linked-lists/`, `trees/`, `graphs/`, `dp/`.
- Each problem: include `solution.<lang>`, `README.md` with approach, complexity, and test cases.
- Pull requests improving explanations, adding problems, or adding tests are welcome.

Quick Next Steps (suggested)
- Pick your primary language and set up the repo structure.
- Start Week 1: implement array & string practice problems and add them under `arrays/` and `strings/`.

If you'd like, I can:
- initialize the recommended folder structure and add starter problem templates,
- or create a lean weekly checklist file you can follow.

Enjoy learning — consistency beats intensity. Happy coding! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
